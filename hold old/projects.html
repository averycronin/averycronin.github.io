			<h2>99</h2><br>
			<p> This game started as a failed attempt to make snake, when I had first
				started playing around with coding in high school.  The result was an 
				odd version of snake where instead of it moving based on time and growing 
				the snake, the field slowly fills with obstacles, while you manually move
				the character.  The current state of the game has no way to win, but I plan
				on making the win condition getting a score of 99, hence the title.  The balancing
				of the game still needs some work to make 99 feasible, but in the meantime try 
				playing for yourself, and get a new high score! </p>

			<h2>Custom PC</h2><br>
			<p> To celebrate earning a scholarship, I decided to use some of my money to build a 
				PC.   I chose the fractal meshify 2 compact white edition for the case, an i7-12700k,
				32 gb 3200 CL16 ram, Asus Z960 plus wifi, and a 3060 ti to power my machine.  I'm excited 
				to run some more demanding games on it.  I also am going to learn video editing on it,
				since that's something I've been interested in, but have never made the time to 
				follow through with that interest. </p>
